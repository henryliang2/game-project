# The Game Project

Game Project is a website to browse through trending and popular games.

Game Project was built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also use Figma and Adobe Creative Suite for prototyping and design.

See the project hosted at https://gameproject.netlify.app

Repository for Node.js server at https://github.com/henryliang2/game-project-backend
